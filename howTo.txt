New things in this module:
1. Using ejs to templating
What we did (New):
  --> Made templates with ejs
  --> Using <%= varName %> tags, and res.render in app.js,
  we can change the value of that variable dynamically

  For making to-do list,
  we made an empty list first in global scope
  the we got the response from client/browser by making a form and posting the response to "/"

  We parsed the response using bodyParser(res.body.{var-name}) and
  appended the result in the list.
  We got redirected to "/" route then.
  Now for templating we made a .ejs file and in that we used for loops to go through each
  element of the list.
  We used <%= %> tag to render the value of the list from "/" route in app.js


Things to take care of:
1. using app.set("view engine","ejs");
2. Since our app runs on server it cannot just use local files, we have to make a dedicated
  folder for that say named "public" ,directory of files inside which will be seen by the
  programs same as that of others and we have to use app.use(express.static("public")) for getting that.
3. For using basic js(loops, if/else etc) inside our .ejs, we have to use <% %> tag.
